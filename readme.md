# WarrantyTrack

PHP application for business owners who are looking for customers inquiries software.
At a shop I'm working at, we are using very bad customers inquiries software, I decided to make a better one ðŸ˜›.

In this application you as the store owner (or your employees), can open inquiry cases for defective products brought by customers in order to track the status of the inquiry..

I developed this project mainly to see if I can build (and finish) a full working project, and to provide a fully working product for your business.

If you are a developer,
Feel free to contribute to this project.

## Installation:

1. Fork the project and upload it to your Apache/Ngix server.
2. Import the included MySql DB. 
3. Adjust the sqlog.php file to point to your DB.
4. Your first time authentication details are:
  ```
  admin
  1234
  ``` 
5. Login to the panel and adjust the Settings.
6. You are all set.
