# WarrantyTrack

PHP solution for buisness owners to track their customers inquiries.
At the shop I'm working at, we have a bad customers inquiries software, I decided to make a better one ðŸ˜›


## Installation:

1. Fork the project and upload it to your server, modify the links inside the php scripts to match your domain.
2. Create new Mysql database with users and cases.
Users will be the users who can login to the panel and cases will be the table for all the cases created.


## Demo
