# WarrantyTrack

PHP application for business owners who are looking for customers inquiries software.

In this application you as the store owner (or your employees), can open inquiry cases for defective products brought by customers in order to track the status of the inquiry.

I've developed this project mainly to see if I can build (and finish) a fully working project, and to see if I can ship a working product.

Feel free to contribute to this project.

## Installation:

1. Fork the project and upload it to your Apache/Nginx server, so files will be accesable in the web.
2. Import the included MySQL DB to your MySQL DB. 
3. Adjust the sqlog.php file credentials so they will point to your MySQL DB.
4. Login to the panel and adjust the Settings.
Your first time authentication details are:
  ```
  admin
  1234
  ```
5. You are all set!
